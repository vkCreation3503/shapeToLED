# shapeToLED
This is project in which a 8x8 matrix of LEDs is used to show 2D shapes. The code is such that there are five inbuilt shapes in the code. The five shapes are : 
1) Rectangle 
2) Square 
3) Triangle 
4) Parallelogram 
5) Trapezium 
We have to select the character that is related to the shape we want to print on the 8x8 matrix and it send it through the serial monitor. This will give 
us the shape that we want to print on the 8x8 matrix.
